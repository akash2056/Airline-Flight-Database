## **üåê Overview**
This project implements a Prolog-based system for querying airline flight information between various airports in the United States. The program demonstrates the power of logical programming for solving complex routing and scheduling problems in the travel domain.

---

## **‚ú® Features**
- **Flight Database**: Comprehensive information about flights between major US airports.
- **Query Capabilities**: Find direct flights, connections, and multi-stop routes.
- **Schedule Analysis**: Determine timing relationships between different flights.
- **Route Finding**: Discover all possible ways to travel between airports.
- **Logical Rules**: Demonstrate the power of declarative programming for travel planning.

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used**
- SWI-Prolog (version 8.0 or higher).
- Logic Programming paradigm.
